GraphQL API Implementation:

Automated Testing:
Write automated tests using a testing framework (e.g., Jest) in TypeScript.
Tests should cover:
Valid queries returning expected data.
Handling of invalid queries or missing users.
Basic performance test: measure and assert that a query resolves within 100ms.
Security test: ensure that querying a non-existent field returns an error.

Constraints:
Use TypeScript and Node.js.
Use any open-source GraphQL server library (e.g., apollo-server, graphql-yoga).
Use Jest or any other popular testing framework.
No external database is required; use in-memory data.
The entire challenge should be solvable within 30 minutes.
No cloud deployment is required for this challenge, but containerization is mandatory.

Deliverables:
GraphQL API server code (TypeScript).

Automated test suite code.
